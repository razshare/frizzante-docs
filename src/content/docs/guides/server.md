title: Server
---

You can create a server using `f.NewServer()`.


```go
//config/server.go

package config

import f "github.com/razshare/frizzante"

var Server = f.NewServer()

```

Then `.Start()` the server.

```go
//main.go

package main

import (
	"embed"
	"main/lib/config"
)

//go:embed .dist/*/**
var dist embed.FS

func main() {
	config.Server.Start(dist)
}
```

:::note
The embedded file system must contain pattern `.dist/*/**`.

This `.dist` directory contains JavaScript assets, 
some which will run on the server and others will be 
served directly to the client.

Contents of this directory are generated by `go run lib/tools/prepare/main.go`,
which is automatically executed by your [makefile](https://github.com/razshare/frizzante-starter/blob/main/makefile) when necessary.
