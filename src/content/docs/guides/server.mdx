title: Creating & Starting a Server
---

import { FileTree} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Make a new file called `lib/server.go` and use `f.NewServer()` to create a new server.

<FileTree>
    - main.go
    - lib
        - server.go
</FileTree>

```go
// lib/server.go
package lib

import f "github.com/razshare/frizzante"

var Server = f.NewServer().WithAddress("127.0.0.1:8080")
```

Then start the server in your `main.go`.

```go
package main

import (
	"embed"
	"main/lib"
)

//go:embed .dist/*/**
var dist embed.FS

func main() {
	lib.Server.Start(dist)
}
```

:::note
The server requires an embedded file system and it must contain pattern `.dist/*/**`.

This `.dist` directory contains JavaScript assets, 
some of which will run on the server and others will be 
served directly to the client.

Contents of this directory are generated by `go run lib/tools/prepare/main.go`,
which is automatically executed by your [makefile](https://github.com/razshare/frizzante-starter/blob/main/makefile) when necessary.
