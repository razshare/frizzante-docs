title: Creating & Starting a Server
---

import { FileTree} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Use `frizzante.NewServer()` to create a new server and `.Start()` to start it.


```go
package main

import (
	"embed"
	"github.com/razshare/frizzante"
)

//go:embed .dist/*/**
var dist embed.FS

func main() {
	frizzante.
		NewServer().
		WithDist(dist).
		Start()
}
```

:::note
The server requires an embedded file system and it must contain pattern `.dist/*/**`.

This `.dist` directory contains JavaScript assets, 
some of which will run on the server and others will be 
served directly to the client.

Contents of this directory are generated by `go run lib/tools/prepare/main.go`,
which is automatically executed by your [makefile](https://github.com/razshare/frizzante-starter/blob/main/makefile) when necessary.
