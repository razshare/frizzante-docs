Frizzante is an opinionated web server framework written in Go that uses Svelte to render web pages.

#### Prerequisites

Install `frizzante`, `air`, `bun`, `build-essential`.

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential
go install github.com/razshare/frizzante@latest
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
which bun || curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

:::tip
Remember to add Go binaries to your path.

```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

#### Get Started

<Steps>
1. Create project with
    ```sh
    frizzante -c MyProject
    ```

1. Install dependencies with
    ```sh
    make install
    ```

1. Start development with

    ```sh
    make dev
    ```

1. Build with

    ```sh
    make build
    ```

    This will create a `.gen/bin/app` standalone executable.

    <FileTree>
        - .gen
            - bin
                - app
    </FileTree>

    :::note
    The final executable uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) bindings to run 
    JavaScript code on the server in order to render svelte components.

    For that reason, the first run may take some time, just be patient.

    Subsequent runs will take considerably less time.
