Frizzante is an opinionated web server framework written in Go that uses Svelte to render web pages.

#### Prerequisites

Install `frizzante`, `air`, `bun`, `build-essential`.

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential
which frizzante || go install github.com/razshare/frizzante@latest
which air || go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
which bun || curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

:::tip
Remember to add Go binaries to your path.

```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```
:::

#### Get Started

<Steps>
1. Create project with
    ```sh
    frizzante -c MyProject
    ```

1. Install dependencies with
    ```sh
    make install
    ```

    :::tip
    The default makefile uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to install 
    dependencies and compile your svelte application into JavaScript.

    You can swap Bun out with whatever runtime you want to use to develop 
    by replacing all `bun` references within the makefile with 
    the equivalent of whatever runtime you'd like to use.

    This change will have no impact on your application's performance, 
    Bun is only used to compile `.svelte` files into `.js` files 
    in development mode or when building for production.
    :::

1. Start development with

    ```sh
    make dev
    ```

1. Build with

    ```sh
    make build
    ```

    This will create a `.gen/bin/app` standalone executable.

    <FileTree>
        - .gen
            - bin
                - app
    </FileTree>

    :::note
    The final executable uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) bindings to run 
    JavaScript code on the server in order to render svelte components.

    For that reason, the first run may take some time, just be patient.

    Subsequent runs will take considerably less time.
