You can create a new project using either **git** or the frizzante **binary**.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem icon='seti:git' label='Git'>
    Clone the basic starter template.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/razshare/frizzante-starter && \
    rm frizzante-starter/.git -fr
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem icon='linux' label='Binary'>
    Install frizzante.
    ```sh
    go install github.com/razshare/frizzante@latest
    ```

    Start the guided setup by running

    ```sh
    frizzante
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Install and configure development dependencies

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential curl unzip && \
make configure
```

Start development with

```sh
make dev
```

:::tip
The default makefile uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to install 
dependencies while in development mode.

You can swap Bun out with whatever runtime you want to use to develop 
by replacing all `bun` references within the makefile with 
the equivalent of whatever runtime you'd like to use.

This change will have no impact on your application's performance, 
Bun is only used to compile `.svelte` files into `.js` files 
in development mode or when building for production.
:::

Build with

```sh
make build
```

This will create a `bin/app` standalone executable.

<FileTree>
    - bin
        - app
</FileTree>

:::note
The final executable uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) bindings to run 
JavaScript code on the server in order to render svelte components.

For that reason, the first run may take some time, just be patient.

Subsequent runs will take considerably less time.

:::note
Frizzante is aimed mainly at debian based distributions.\
Feel free to contribute improvements for other platforms.
