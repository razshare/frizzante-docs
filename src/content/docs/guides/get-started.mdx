import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can create a new project using either **git** or the frizzante **binary**.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem icon='seti:git' label='Git'>
    Clone the basic starter template.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/razshare/frizzante-starter && \
    rm frizzante-starter/.git -fr && \
    cd frizzante-starter
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem icon='linux' label='Binary'>
    Install frizzante.
    ```sh
    go install github.com/razshare/frizzante@latest
    ```

    Create a new project.

    ```sh
    frizzante -generate -project -out="my-project"
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Update dependencies and generate [render files](../views#render-files).

```sh
make update generate
```

Start development with

```sh
make dev
```

:::note
Make sure you have [build-essential](https://askubuntu.com/questions/398489/how-to-install-build-essential) and
[Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed.
:::

:::tip
The default makefile uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to install dependencies while in development mode.

You can swap Bun out with whatever runtime you wanna use to develop by replacing all `bun` and `bunx` references within 
the make file with the equivalent of whatever runtime you'd like to use.

Note that this will have no impact on your application's performance, Bun is only used in development mode 
in order to be able to run the Vite server.

And build with

```sh
make build
```

:::note
The final output is a standalone executable.
