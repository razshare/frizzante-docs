import { Tabs, TabItem, FileTree, CardGrid, Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

1. Create a new project using the starter template.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/razshare/frizzante-starter && \
    rm frizzante-starter/.git -fr
    ```

    <Card title='Binary' icon='linux'>
    You can also use the Frizzante binary to create a new project.

    Install the binary with
    ```sh
    go install github.com/razshare/frizzante@latest
    ```

    Then run

    ```sh
    frizzante
    ```
    </Card>

2. Configure project with

    ```sh
    make configure
    ```

    :::note
    This requires that you have `build-essential`, `curl` and `unzip` installed on your machine.

3. Start development with

    ```sh
    make dev
    ```

    :::tip
    The default makefile uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to install 
    dependencies while in development mode.

    You can swap Bun out with whatever runtime you want to use to develop 
    by replacing all `bun` references within the makefile with 
    the equivalent of whatever runtime you'd like to use.

    This change will have no impact on your application's performance, 
    Bun is only used to compile `.svelte` files into `.js` files 
    in development mode or when building for production.
    :::

4. Build with

    ```sh
    make build
    ```

    This will create a `bin/app` standalone executable.

    <FileTree>
        - bin
            - app
    </FileTree>

    :::note
    The final executable uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) bindings to run 
    JavaScript code on the server in order to render svelte components.

    For that reason, the first run may take some time, just be patient.

    Subsequent runs will take considerably less time.
