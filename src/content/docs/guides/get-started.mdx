#### Get Started

<Steps>
1. Create project with

    ```sh
    frizzante -c MyProject
    ```

1. Configure project

    ```sh
    make configure
    ```

1. Start development with

    ```sh
    make dev
    ```

1. Build with

    ```sh
    make build
    ```

    This will create a `.gen/bin/app` standalone executable.

    <FileTree>
        - .gen
            - bin
                - app
    </FileTree>

    :::note
    The final executable uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) bindings to run 
    JavaScript code on the server in order to render svelte components.

    For that reason, the first run may take some time, just be patient.

    Subsequent runs will take considerably less time.

    Frizzante is aimed mainly at linux distributions.\
