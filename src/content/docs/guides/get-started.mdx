Frizzante is a minimalistic and opinionated web server framework written in Go that uses Svelte to render pages.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have `build-essential`, `curl` and `unzip` installed on your machine.

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential unzip curl
```

## Create Project

<Steps>
1. Install frizzante
    ```sh
    go install github.com/razshare/frizzante@latest
    ```
1. Create project
    ```sh
    frizzante -c MyProject
    ```

1. Start development with

    ```sh
    make dev
    ```

    :::tip
    The default makefile uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to install 
    dependencies while in development mode.

    You can swap Bun out with whatever runtime you want to use to develop 
    by replacing all `bun` references within the makefile with 
    the equivalent of whatever runtime you'd like to use.

    This change will have no impact on your application's performance, 
    Bun is only used to compile `.svelte` files into `.js` files 
    in development mode or when building for production.

1. Build with

    ```sh
    make build
    ```

    This will create a `.gen/bin/app` standalone executable.

    <FileTree>
        - bin
            - app
    </FileTree>

    :::note
    The final executable uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) bindings to run 
    JavaScript code on the server in order to render svelte components.

    For that reason, the first run may take some time, just be patient.

    Subsequent runs will take considerably less time.

    Frizzante is aimed mainly at linux distributions.\
