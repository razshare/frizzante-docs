You can create a new project using either **git** or the frizzante **binary**.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem icon='seti:git' label='Git'>
    Clone the basic starter template.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/razshare/frizzante-starter && \
    rm frizzante-starter/.git -fr && \
    cd frizzante-starter
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem icon='linux' label='Binary'>
    Install frizzante.
    ```sh
    go install github.com/razshare/frizzante@latest
    ```

    Create a new project.

    ```sh
    frizzante -generate -project -out="my-project"
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Generate utilities and update dependencies.

```sh
make generate update
```

:::note
Make sure [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [build-essential](https://askubuntu.com/questions/398489/how-to-install-build-essential) are installed.
:::

:::tip
The default makefile uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to install dependencies while in development mode.

You can swap Bun out with whatever runtime you want to use to develop by replacing all `bun` and `bunx` references within the makefile with the equivalent of whatever runtime you'd like to use.

Note that this will have no impact on your application's performance, Bun is only used in development mode 
in order to be able to run the Vite server.
:::

Start development with

```sh
make dev
```

Build with

```sh
make build
```

This will create a `bin/app` standalone executable.

<FileTree>
    - bin
        - app
</FileTree>

:::note
The final executable uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) bindings to run JavaScript code on the server in order to render svelte components.

For that reason, the first build or launch may take some time, just be patient.<br/>
Once that is done, subsequent builds or launches will take considerably less time.
