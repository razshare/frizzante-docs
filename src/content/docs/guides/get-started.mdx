Frizzante is an opinionated web server framework written in Go that uses Svelte to render web pages.

#### Prerequisites

Install `frizzante`.

```sh
go install github.com/razshare/frizzante@latest
```

:::tip
Remember to add Go binaries to your path.

```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

#### Get Started

<Steps>
1. Create a project.

    ```sh
    frizzante -c MyProject
    ```

1. Configure project.

    ```sh
    frizzante --configure
    ```

1. Start development.

    ```sh
    frizzante --dev
    ```

1. Build.

    ```sh
    frizzante --build
    ```

    This will create a `.gen/bin/app` standalone executable.

    <FileTree>
        - .gen
            - bin
                - app
    </FileTree>
</Steps>


:::note
The final executable uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) bindings to run 
JavaScript code on the server in order to render svelte components.

For that reason, the first run may take some time, just be patient.

Subsequent runs will take considerably less time.
