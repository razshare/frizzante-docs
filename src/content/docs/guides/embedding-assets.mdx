title: Embedding Assets
---

You can embed assets into your binary so that you don't have to carry around your `app/dist` directory.

Use `server.WithEfs()` to set the server embedded file system.

```go
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "github.com/razshare/frizzante/server"
)

//go:embed app/dist
var efs embed.FS

func main() {
    server.WithEfs(efs)
    server.Start()
}
```

Not only serving a file with `SendFileOrElse()` also takes into account the embedded file system, but
your views' bundles are also included in the embedded file system, which makes your final binary
completely standalone.

:::tip
The **host** file system **has precedence** over the embedded file system.

This means you can add a custom `app/dist` directory nearby your binary in order to serve
files that were not originally embedded into the binary.
