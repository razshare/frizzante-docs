This document describes the full process of setting up a fully working local development environment and submitting your first contribution.

## Clone Repositories

Clone `frizzante`.

```go
git clone https://github.com/razshare/frizzante
```

Clone `frizzante-starter`.

```go
git clone https://github.com/razshare/frizzante-starter
```

:::tip
If you don't have direct access to these repositories you will need to fork your own `frizzante` and `frizzante-starter` repositories and clone those instead.

Then when you're done with your changes you will need to submit a pull request.
:::

## Install Frizzante Cli

Install the frizzante cli using the go cli

```go
go install github.com/razshare/frizzante@latest
```

Make sure that Go binaries are on your path.

```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

## Configure Projects

Navigate to your `frizzante` local repository and configure the project with make.

```sh
make configure
```

This will install `bun` and `air` in `.gen`.

Navigate to your `frizzante-starter` local repository and configure the project with make.

```sh
make configure
```

This will install `bun` and `air` in `.gen`.

## Local Frizzante Package

You most likely will want to try out your `frizzante` changes locally.

By default, your local `frizzante-starter` will pull the `frizzante` package from the public remote repository.\
You can link your local `frizzante-starter` to your local version of `frizzante` instead, in order to have immediate feedback.

Navigate to your `frizzante-starter` repository and modify your `go.mod` file to replace the remote `frizzante` dependency with the local one using `replace` syntax.


```go
//go.mod
module main

go 1.24

// ...
replace github.com/razshare/frizzante => /home/user1/path/to/frizzante
require github.com/razshare/frizzante v1.17.2
// ...
```

This will make it so that changes to your local `frizzante` project are immediately picked up when building your local `frizzante-starter`.

:::note
Another reason for using local packages is to avoid unnecessary mirror caching in https://proxy.golang.org/.

**Explanation**

Whenever you request packages for your Go program, these packages are by default fetched from the Go module mirror.

The Go module mirror automatically caches package requests for 30 minutes, regardless if the requested package or version of the package actually exists or not.

This means that if you modify, for example

```go
require github.com/razshare/frizzante v1.17.2
```

Into

```go
require github.com/razshare/frizzante v1.17.3
```

And `v1.17.3` doesn't actually exist yet, your package request will be rejected with a `404 Not Found`.\
That response is then cached for 30 minutes.

This means that subsequent requests for `v1.17.3` will fail until the cached state is evicted, even if in the meantime `v1.17.3` has actually been published.

Some IDEs will save your `go.mod` file and try update the package version **automatically**!

Such an example is [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go).

Pointing to a local version of the package using `replace` avoids all this.

## Create Branch

Create a new branch and give it a name that describes your changes.

```sh
git checkout -b feature/some-feature
```

## Coding Standards

Submitted code must follow a few rules.


### Export Everything

All package functions, variables and structure fields **must always be exported**.

```go
//package1/types.go
type MyStruct struct {
  Field1 string
  Field2 int
  Field3 bool
  Field4 any
}
func MyFunction(){}
const Planet = "Earth"
var Name = "World"
```

### Data & Logic

Data and logic must be separated, don't **define receiver functions** unless you're forced
to by some third party package.

This type of code should be avoided

```go
type MyStruct struct {
  field1 string
}

func (str *MyStruct) MyFunction(){
  str.field1 = "Hello!"
}
```

and be instead converted into

```go
type MyStruct struct {
  Field1 string
}

func MyFunction(str *MyStruct){
  str.Field1 = "Hello!"
}
```

## Pull Requests

When you're done with your changes you can submit a pull request in order to implement them into `frizzante` (or `frizzante-starter`).

## Testing

### Automation

Tests will automatically run through GitHub actions when pushing into main or when pull requests are opened into main.

:::tip
If you want to make sure tests pass before pushing anything, you can run them locally.

```sh
make test
```
:::

### Servers

Do not start multiple servers when testing features.

The whole test suite makes use of one single server, which is initialized in [init_test.go](https://github.com/razshare/frizzante/blob/main/init_test.go).

This keeps the test suite fast.
