Use `Session()` to start a session.

```go
//lib/handlers/hello.go
package handlers

import "github.com/razshare/frizzante/frz"

type State struct{}

func Hello(c *frz.Connection) {
    state, operator := frz.Session(c, State{})
}
```

This will retrieve the user's session or create a new one if none is found.

:::note
The session is retrieved based on the user's `session-id` cookie.

When session retrieval fails, `Session()` creates a 
new session instead and sends a new `session-id` cookie to the user.
:::

:::danger
Since `Session()` may send a cookie, it is important to remember that
the order in which data is sent to the user matters.

Read more about [order of operations](../order-of-operations).

## State & operator

Session state and session operations are handled separately.

When invoking `Session()`, you're given back a `state` and an `operator`.

Use the `operator` to save, reload or destroy the state.

```go
//lib/handlers/hello.go
package handlers

import "github.com/razshare/frizzante/frz"

type State struct{
    Name string
}

func Hello(c *frz.Connection) {
    state, operator := frz.Session(c, State{})
    defer operator.Save(state)
    state.Name = "world"
}
```

## Archive

Sessions are managed through the operator's `Archive`.

You can overwrite the default `Archive` of any operator using `WithArchive()`.

```go
//lib/handlers/hello.go
package handlers

import "github.com/razshare/frizzante/frz"

type State struct{
    Name string
}

func Hello(c *frz.Connection) {
    state, operator := frz.Session(c, State{})
    operator.WithArchive(MyCustomArchive)
    defer operator.Save(state)
    state.Name = "world"
}
```

An `Archive` is an interface defined as follows

```go
type Archive interface {
    Get(domain string, key string) ([]byte, error)
    Set(domain string, key string, value []byte) error
    Has(domain string, key string) (bool, error)
    Remove(domain string, key string) error
    HasDomain(domain string) (bool, error)
    RemoveDomain(domain string) error
}
```

Think of it as a repository of data separated in two layers, `domains` and `keys`.

An archive contains `domains` which contains `keys`.

In the case of session management, a `domain` is identified by the session id, while the `key` is 
a file named `session.json`.

<FileTree>
    - .archive
        - domain-1
            - key-a.txt
            - key-b.txt
        - domain-2
            - key-x.txt
            - key-y.txt
</FileTree>

The default sessions archive is backed by the file system.

In other words, the default sessions archive organizes sessions in a `.sessions` directory
containing as many subdirectories as there are sessions.

Each subdirectory contains a `session.json` file
which describes the state of each session.

<FileTree>
    - .sessions
        - 0d0d0c2f-6bb9-405f-6a41-d4fe9acf3dd2
            - session.json
        - 8a6d8cfa-2fc7-4dbb-6be9-beb823318303
            - session.json
</FileTree>

```json
//./sessions/0d0d0c2f-6bb9-405f-6a41-d4fe9acf3dd2/session.json
{
    "Name": "world"
}
```
