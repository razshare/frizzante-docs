title: Sessions
---

Use `Session()` to start a session.

```go
//lib/handlers/hello.go
package handlers

import frz "github.com/razshare/frizzante"

type State struct{}

func GetHello(c *frz.Connection) {
    state, operator := frz.Session(c, State{})
}
```

This will retrieve the user's session or create a new one if none is found.

:::note
If the user provides a `session-id` cookie `Session()` will try and find that session,
otherwise it will create a new session with a new id.

When this happens, `Session()` will automatically send the new id to the user
using a `session-id` cookie.
:::

:::danger
Since `Session()` may send a cookie, it is important to remember that
the order in which data is sent to the user matters.

Read more about [order of operations](../routes#order-of-operations).

## State & Operator

Session state and session operations are handled separately.

When invoking `Session()`, you're given back a `state` and an `operator`.

Use the `operator` to save, reload or destroy the state.

```go
//lib/handlers/hello.go
package handlers

import frz "github.com/razshare/frizzante"

type State struct{
    Name string
}

func GetHello(c *frz.Connection) {
    state, operator := frz.Session(c, State{})
    defer operator.Save(state)
    state.Name = "world"
}
```
