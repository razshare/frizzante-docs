### How do I completely disable SSR?

Use an **index server** instead of a **container server**.

```go
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "github.com/razshare/frizzante/svelte/index/server"
)

//go:embed app/dist
var efs embed.FS
var srv = server.Default(efs)

func main() {
    defer server.Start(srv)
}
```

This will completely drop the server side JavaScript engine and also shrink the 
size of your final binary from a minimum of 24MB to a minimum of 10MB.

:::note
[Render modes](../views#render-modes) configurations will be completely ignored and calls to `send.View()` will always render as [view.RenderModeClient](../views#rendermodeclient).
