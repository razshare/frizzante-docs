### How do I completely disable SSR?

Configure your container to use `0` parallels.

```go
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "github.com/razshare/frizzante/server"
)

//go:embed app/dist
var efs embed.FS
var conf = server.Default()

func main() {
    defer server.Start(conf)
    server.Container.Efs = efs
    server.Container.Parallels = 0
}
```

Then make sure your views are automatically set to use client side rendering only, for example, 
by defining your own view constructor.

```go
package views

import "github.com/razshare/frizzante/view"

// New creates a new view.
func New(name string, data map[string]any) view.View {
    return view.View{
       Name:      name,
       Data:      data,
       RenderMode: view.RenderModeClient,
    }
}
```
