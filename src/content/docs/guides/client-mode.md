title: Client Mode
---

In client mode no actual JavaScript code is executed on the server.

The server will serve an empty HTML document which will 
asynchronously load you application JavaScript bundle, allowing it 
to take over the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) and finally render content to the screen.
